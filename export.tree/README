README for OpenfMRI dataset ds000164


### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###
===========================================

General Comments
----------------
- In the events files, all the events have a duration of 1 seconds. This was the actual 
length of the events. However, in their models, the authors used a duration equal to one TR 
length (1.5s).

Defacing
--------
Pydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure 
deindentification of subjects. The code
can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface


Quality Control
---------------
We are having difficulties running MRIQC and have not included the results in this 
revision. These should be present in the next revision.

Where to discuss the dataset
----------------------------
1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments 
section at the bottom of the dataset
page.
2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with 
the tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX
accession number.
3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please 
include the dsXXXXXX accession number in
your email.


Known Issues
------------
The header information for the functional files conflicts with the information provided in the manuscript (.e.g., the voxel size is 3.2 mm × 3.2 mm × 4 mm in the manuscript but 3.5 mm isotropic in the header). The acquired voxel size was 3.5mm isotropic.

Bids-validator Output
---------------------

This dataset appears to be BIDS compatible.
